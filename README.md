# Scattered_Points_Groups

 Finds groups of close-by point clusters.

Given scattered points in the X-Y plane with coordinates (x0, y0), (x1, y1), â€¦, (xn, yn), write a Python
function that finds groups of close-by point clusters. The number of required clusters is an input
to this function. Write a simple test to demonstrate this functionality.
